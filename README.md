Karmacracy API
==============

This is not exactly an API, It's more a wrapper for the Karmacracy REST API for C#. 
Right now is under heavy development, and the idea is that the API endpoints have a strong test coverage. 
Right now the C# solution uses XUnit for testing.

I'm planning to port it to other languages too, so if you are interested, send a pull request!

VERY IMPORTANT
==============

For this to work you need a Karmacracy API Key, that you can obtain sending an e-mail to api@karmacracy.com, They surely give you one, for free!
