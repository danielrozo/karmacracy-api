== Karmacracy API ==

OK this maybe is not an api, just a wrapper for the Karmacracy REST API for C#. Right now is under heavy development, and the idea is that the API endpoints have a strong test coverage.

I'm planning to port it to other languages too, so if you are interested, send a pull request!

=== VERY IMPORTANT ===

For this to work you need a Karmacracy API Key, that you can obtain sending an e-mail to api@karmacracy.com, They surely give you one, for free!
